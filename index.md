I am currently pursuing a Masters of Computer Science at UT Austin. I started Fall 2024 and plan to graduate December 2025.

In between undergrad and grad school, I was a research intern at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/), through the [SULI](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) and [RSI](https://education.ornl.gov/rsi/) programs.

I graduated from Auburn University in May 2023 with a Bachelors of Software Engineering and minors in Physics and Mathematics.  While there, I engaged in a three-semester co-op in full stack web development at [UDA Technologies](https://www.udatechnologies.com/index) and Georgia State's 2022 [Immersive Media REU](https://gsu-reu.netlify.app/). I was part of Auburn's Competitive Programming Team and AI Club.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy camping, biking, and running a D&D campaign.
