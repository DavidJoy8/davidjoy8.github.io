## Research Interests

My research interests are at the intersections of quantum computing, high-performance computing, and artifical intelligence.  My current primary interest is the use of quantum computing for classical optimization problems, specifically using QAOA to boost the performance of genetic algorithms.  I plan to pursue this as my MSCS thesis and am currently searching for an advisor.

## Past Research

During the 2023-2024 academic year, I was a research intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  I completed four separate research projects.  Each semester included a poster presentation and other deliverables.

**Summer 2023:** I was mentored by Dr. [Stephen DeWitt](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/stephen-dewitt) and Dr. [Sam Reeve](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/samuel-t-reeve). I developed [CabanaPF](https://github.com/ORNL/CabanaPF), a phase-field code built on Cabana and Kokkos. These are exascale HPC libraries focused on cross-platform portability, which allowed me to run my code on ORNL's Summit and Frontier supercomputers. This work was published in ["Co-design for Particle Applications at Exascale"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10490005).

**Fall 2023:** I was mentored by Dr. [Prasanna Date](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/prasanna-date).  I created a method to run a genetic algorithm on a quantum computer using amplitude amplification.  I implemented my method using IBM Qiskit and tested it on problems including Max-Cut and classifying the Iris dataset.  In these noiseless simulations, it produced better solutions than the equivalent classical genetic algorithm.

**Spring 2024:** I was mentored by Dr. [Stephen DeWitt](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/stephen-dewitt).  I worked as part of the NEETER center, which researches electrifying industrial-scale chemistry.  I built an active learning Gaussian Process service in ORNL's INTERSECT autonomous science ecosystem.  This service sits in-the-loop with a data source and repeatedly suggests data points to optimize an experiment or simulation.  Along with collaborators at Georgia Tech, we used this service to find parameters for a computational chemistry model that best matched experimental data.

**Summer 2024:** I was mentored by Dr. [Jordan Stomps](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/jordan-r-stomps) and Dr. [Scott Stewart](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/scott-l-stewart).  I created a dataset of radiation portal data and used it to fine-tune the large multi-modal LLaVA model.  This fine-tuned model is capable of identifying domain-specific features in the data and will be used to help identify issues with the radiation detectors.
